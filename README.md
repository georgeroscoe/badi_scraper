Bot that continually scrapes the flat listings page on Badi given a search area, and alerts as soon as a new flat is listed.

Alerts are sent via Pushbullet, which you'll need to generate a token for, and I hosted the bot on Heroku.

To get the right search link, you need to change the query parameters to fit what you're looking for.

Once you have a Pushbullet token and the right search link, put them in the test-data.json file, and rename it to data.json
